                <h3>Steps in coooking Adobo</h3>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>Marinate The Pork Belly In Soy Sauce And Crushed Garlic
                        <p>The first thing to do is marinate the pork belly in soy 
                            sauce and crushed garlic. It is best to marinate it 
                            overnight. If time is limited, one hour should be 
                            enough. Some like to add vinegar during the process. 
                            You may do so if preferred.</p></li>
                    <li>Brown The Marinated Pork
                        <p>Drain the marinade. Save it for later. The marinated 
                            pork needs to be browned. Heat a cooking pot. Add pork 
                            with garlic. You can also add a few tablespoons of 
                            cooking oil. Cook the pork until it turns brown.</p></li>
                    <li>Pour Water And Add The Spices
                        <p>Cook the pork until tender. Do this by pouring the 
                            remaining marinade, if any. Also add water. Let the 
                            liquid boil. This is the part where I put the whole 
                            peppercorn and dried bay leaves. These ingredients 
                            complete my pork adobo. Boiling for 40 minutes should 
                            be enough to tenderize the pork. There are times when 
                            you have to cook longer.</p></li>
                    <li>Add The Vinegar
                        <p>If you have not added the vinegar as part of the 
                            marinade, pour it into the pot and let it cook for 
                            10 minutes. Salt is an optional ingredient for this 
                            recipe. Use it only if you think it is needed.</p></li>
                    <li>Season
                        <p>Taste the sauce first so that you know what seasonings 
                            to add. Since we already added a good amount of soy 
                            sauce, salt might not be needed. However, this depends 
                            on your preference. You can also add more water here if 
                            you think that then saltiness is on the upper side. 
                            Sometimes I also add a dash of sugar to balance the 
                            flavor.</p></li>
