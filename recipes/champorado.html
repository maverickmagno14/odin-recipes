                <p class="food-description">
                    Champorado is a sweet chocolate rice porridge that uses sweet 
                    glutinous rice (locally known as malagkit) and cocoa powder 
                    as main ingredients. A more traditional approach would be 
                    using tableya (pure cocoa blocks) instead of cocoa powder. 
                    This porridge can be served hot or cold and is mostly eaten 
                    during breakfast. This can also be served during 
                    mid-afternoon snacks (meryenda) and is best when complimented 
                    with Tuyo (salted dried fish).
